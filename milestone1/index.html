            <h2>Website Summary</h2>
            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>Articles focusing on tips and tricks for travling in China. Including how to get the visa, how to book things, apps to get, etc.</p>

            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>I will write the content myself, and use pictures of my travels in China or screenshots from my phone for the apps.</p>

            <h4>Why should users care about the focus on the site?</h4>
            <p>It can be intimidating to travel to China, because there are lots of things to be prepared for such as a visa or payment methods. Having a website that helps prepare you is very helpful for potential tourists.</p>

            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>A website is the most efficient way to spread travling information, as it can get lost in social media.</p>

            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>I want them to come here when the google "how to get a visa for china" or other topics like that. I want them to come here and get information, and potentially click on affilate links for hotels or VPNs.</p>

            <h4>What is the goal of the site</h4>
            <p>My goal is to educate and give high quality and current information for people to have a good and easy time to get to China.</p>
