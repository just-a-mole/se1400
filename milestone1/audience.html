        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>I will be focusing on people from the United States</p>

        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>I want a broader age range, anywhere from 18-50. I want to have more focused articles for young adults</p>

        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>There won't be a specific gender I focus on </p>

        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>I want to target people that are doing research on their first trip to China, for a normal middle class individual or small family.</p>
        <p>Also I want to get people that have been to the major tourist attractions and want a new unpopular place to visit, and want tips on how to travel there.</p>
