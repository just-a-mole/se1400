                <h2>Shanghai 3 day Guide: Disney, The Bund, and Museums</h2>
                <p>Shanghai is a city where the future crashes into the past. One minute you are standing in front of a
                    100-year-old
                    European bank, and the next you are riding a lightcycle in a digital grid. To help you navigate this
                    massive
                    metropolis.</p>

                <h3>1. Shanghai Disney</h3>
                <p>Shanghai Disney Resort is home to some of the best rides in the world, including the TRON ride.
                    However, crowds can be intense. Here is how to
                    survive:
                </p>
                <img src="photos/castle.jpg" id="castle-photo" alt="castle">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Download the App First:</strong> Before you even enter the park, download the official
                        Shanghai Disney Resort App. You will need it to check wait times, view the map,
                        and view times for shows.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Get there early:</strong> It is a very long walk to get to the entrance, so come at
                        least 1 hour early so you can get into the park at opening. Make sure to bring your passport
                        too!
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't worry about ride orders:</strong> For the most part, you can experience all of the
                        rides in a single day without preperation. However the exception is the Zootopia Land. People
                        will rush there and there will be a line just to get into the area.
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Best way to do the Bund</h3>
                <p>The Bund offers the most iconic view in Shanghai. the historic colonial buildings on one side
                    and the
                    futuristic skyline on the other, along with pleanty of shopping and activities.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visiting at night:</strong> The bund during the day is calm and even a bit relaxing,
                        however visitng at night is a completely different story. The walkway to see the skyline on the
                        colonial side will be stuffed with people shoulder to shoulder. Be prepared to push your way to
                        get a view.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beware of shops:</strong> The bund has hundereds of different shops packed together, all
                        targeting all different kidns of tourists. You may find that some trinkets are very expensive.
                        But don't worry, the further out you go from the bund, the cheaper things will become. The same
                        goes for food and drinks. However even on the bund, food and drinks are not too expensive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Preparing for Museums</h3>
                <p>Shanghai has world-class museums, but the days of just "walking in" are over. Almost all major
                    museums now
                    require advance reservation via WeChat.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shanghai Museum:</strong> This is the place for ancient Chinese art,
                        bronze, and
                        ceramics. Tickets are free but must be booked days in advance on their official WeChat
                        mini-program. For forigners, you may have trouble getting in, but the staff are very kind and
                        are willing to help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center:</strong> Located near the Shanghai Museum,
                        this is a
                        hidden gem. The third floor features a massive scale model of the entire city of Shanghai. It
                        gives you a
                        perspective on the sheer scale of the city that you cannot get anywhere else.</li>
                    <li><strong>M50 Creative Park:</strong> If you prefer modern art over ancient history, head to
                        Moganshan Road. It is a complex of converted warehouses filled with contemporary art galleries,
                        street art, and coffee shops.</li>
